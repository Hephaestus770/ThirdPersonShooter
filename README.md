# ThirdPersonShooter
This is my Unreal 5 project made in C++ (I used blueprint for targets and openable door) and it's still at a very early stage. The most challenging part was the drone. Actually, I started with a very simple idea, the drone was gonna automatically follow the player and shoot targets in a certain distance. Then I saw a very cool, physics-based, controllable ship in Unreal Content Samples. It was done in the blueprint, so I converted it to C++ and made improvements to it. You can take a look at Drone.cpp in the Source file to see how the drone works. For now, you can spawn and control the drone for a limited time, but I'll probably change that limitation. I plan to add new mechanics to the drone to make it more interactive with the environment. Finally, I know it is still far from that but my goal is to make a very small and short game with story and some choices. (like a one Mass Effect mission).  </br>
