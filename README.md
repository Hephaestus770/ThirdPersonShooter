# ThirdPersonShooter
This is my Unreal 5 project made in C++ (I used blueprint for targets and openable door) and it's still at a very early stage. The most challenging part was the drone. You can take a look at Drone.cpp in the Source file to see how the drone works, I think it's self explanatory code. </br>
